                   OpenPF Plot-File Standard
	                   Version 1.0  June 1, 1995


	        OpenPF is an open, nonproprietary standard for computer
	files that contain electromagnetic-field data.  OpenPF is
	intended for files created by antenna-analysis programs and for
	files containing measurements.  OpenPF files can be used to
	archive or transport data.  Programs can use the files to plot
	fields and radiation patterns on a screen, printer, or plotter.

	        The OpenPF file format is extensible.  Data is organized
	into blocks that begin with a block-type identifier followed by
	block length.  This structure allows a file parser to skip and
	ignore blocks it's not designed to handle, including block types
	defined in future revisions of OpenPF.

	        The blocks defined below provide for 2-D relative far-
	field data (azimuth and elevation radiation patterns) and 3-D
	absolute near- and far-field data.  3-D radiation patterns can
	be represented by a set of 2-D data blocks.

	        The file format enables a single file to contain near-
	and far-field data, absolute and relative data, azimuth and
	elevation data, low- and high-resolution data, partial- and
	full-data cuts, data for multiple frequencies, and unidentified
	data.

	        The file format provides for new fields in future OpenPF
	revisions without the overhead of reserved bytes.  New fields
	can be appended to any file block.  File parsers that use block
	length to advance to the next block will skip over new fields.

	        OpenPF uses standard coordinate systems.  For
	rectangular coordinates, X and Y are in the horizontal plane and
	Z is height.  For spherical coordinates, R is radial distance,
	phi is azimuth angle, and theta is zenith angle.  For
	cylindrical coordinates, rho is horizontal distance, phi is
	azimuth angle, and z is height.  Azimuth angle is 0 along the X
	axis and increases in the XY plane toward the Y axis
	(counterclockwise).  Zenith angle is 0 along the Z axis and
	increases in the Z-phi plane toward the phi ray.  Units are
	meters and degrees.

	        OpenPF files use the Intel-processor "little-endian"
	data convention (least-significant byte first for multibyte
	data).  Bit number 0 is the least-significant bit.  Bits marked
	as reserved are undefined and should not be assumed to be 0.
	OpenPF files use the file extension ".PF".

	        In the descriptions that follow, word means a 16-bit
	unsigned integer and FP means a 32-bit, single-precision,
	floating-point number that conforms to the IEEE-754-1985
	standard.  ASCII means a character string that uses the
	extended-ASCII PC-8 symbol set.





	                             Header


	        OpenPF files begin with a block of the following format:


	                Version                 byte
	                Header length           word
	                Source length           byte
	                Title length            byte
	                Environment length      byte
	                Notes length            word
	                Source                  ASCII
	                Title                   ASCII
	                Environment             ASCII
	                Notes                   ASCII


	Version

	        This byte identifies the OpenPF version used to generate
	the file.  The version number consists of a major revision (an
	integer) and a minor revision (an integer between 0 and 9)
	separated by a decimal point.  The upper nibble (4 bits)
	contains the major revision and the lower nibble the minor.


	Header Length

	        This field is the total length of the header in bytes.
	File parsers should use this length to advance past the header
	instead of assuming that data blocks begin immediately after the
	notes string.  Future OpenPF revisions may define additional
	fields after the notes string.  Header lengths less than 3 are
	invalid.


	Source, Title, Environment, and Notes Lengths

	        These fields specify the lengths in bytes of the ASCII
	strings.  Zero is valid.


	Source String

	        This string identifies the data source.  This may be an
	antenna-analysis program, an antenna-test range, a laboratory,
	etc.  No bytes are allocated for a zero-length string.


	Title, Environment, and Notes Strings

	        The title string describes the antenna.  The environment
	string describes the antenna environment (free space, antenna
	height, ground constants, etc.).  The notes string contains
	auxiliary information that might be displayed only upon request.
	Data blocks that follow may contain strings that override these
	global strings.  No bytes are allocated for zero-length strings.


	                          Data Blocks


	        Data following the header is organized into blocks.
	Each data block begins with block type (a byte) followed by
	block length (a word).  Block types 0 through 127 are standard
	and reserved.  Programs may use types 128 through 255 for
	special purposes, but block length must always follow block type
	so that file parsers can skip over the block.  Blocks may appear
	in any order.  The following standard blocks are defined:


	                           NOP Block


	                Block type              byte (0)
	                Block length            word
	                Rest of block


	        Block type 0 is a no-operation block.  Its purpose is to
	provide a standard ignore-me block.  Normally this block isn't
	used, but it may be convenient when patching a file.  Block
	length is the total length of the block in bytes.  Block lengths
	less than 3 are invalid.


	                   Relative Far-Field Blocks


	                Block type              byte (1-16)
	                Block length            word
	                Title length            byte
	                Environment length      byte
	                Notes length            word
	                Frequency               FP
	                Plane                   byte
	                Plane angle             FP
	                Symmetry                byte
	                Number of points        word
	                First angle             FP
	                Angular increment       FP
	                Data points             each FP

	Block Type

	        Block types 1-16 contain planar cuts of relative far-
	field data as follows:

	Block           Data                    Units

	  1     Total magnitude                 dBi
	  2     Horizontal magnitude            dBi
	  3     Vertical magnitude              dBi


	  4     Right-circular magnitude        dBic
	  5     Left-circular magnitude         dBic
	  6     Major-axis magnitude            dBi
	  7     Minor-axis magnitude            dBi
	  8     Ellipticity                     dB
	  9     Total phase                     degrees
	 10     Horizontal phase                degrees
	 11     Vertical phase                  degrees
	 12     Right-circular phase            degrees
	 13     Left-circular phase             degrees
	 14     Major-axis phase                degrees
	 15     Minor-axis phase                degrees
	 16     Polarization tilt               degrees

	        Ellipticity is the length of the minor axis of the
	polarization ellipse divided by the length of the major axis
	expressed in dB (the IEEE-754-1985 floating-point code for
	-infinity is valid).  Polarization tilt is the counterclockwise
	angle between the major axis and the E(theta) direction.


	Block Length

	        This field is the total length of the block in bytes.
	Block lengths less than 3 are invalid.


	Title, Environment, and Notes Lengths

	        These fields specify the lengths of the ASCII strings in
	bytes.  Zero is valid.


	Frequency

	        Frequency is in MHz.


	Plane

	        This byte is 0 for azimuth data (constant zenith angle)
	and 1 for elevation data (constant azimuth angle).  Other values
	are reserved.


	Plane Angle

	        This field is the zenith angle for azimuth data and the
	azimuth angle for elevation data.




	Symmetry

	        The bits of this byte have the following meaning when
	set:

	        Bit     Azimuth Data       Elevation Data

	         0      X symmetry         XY symmetry
	         1      Y symmetry         Z symmetry

	        Symmetry means that the data has the same value when
	reflected about the line or plane indicated.  For azimuth data,
	bits 0 and 1 refer to the X and Y axes.  For elevation data,
	they refer to the XY plane and the Z axis.  Both bits may be set
	simultaneously.  Bits 2-7 are reserved.


	Number of Points

	        This field is the number of data points that follow.  0
	is valid.


	First Angle

	        This field is the angle of the first data point.


	Angular Increment

	        This field defines the sign and magnitude of the angular
	difference between successive data points.


	Data Points

	        The data set begins at the first angle.  The angles of
	successive data samples differ by the angular increment.


	Title, Environment, and Notes Strings

	        When string length is nonzero, the string overrides the
	corresponding header string for this block.  When zero, the
	header string applies for this block and no string space is
	allocated.

	        Block types 64-81 contain absolute fields.  Block types
	67-81 are field components resolved in rectangular coordinates.
	These blocks are defined as follows:

	 73     Hx magnitude            amps/meter
	 74     Hy magnitude            amps/meter
	 75     Hz magnitude            amps/meter
	 76     Ex phase                degrees
	 77     Ey phase                degrees
	 78     Ez phase                degrees
	 79     Hx phase                degrees
	 80     Hy phase                degrees
	 81     Hz phase                degrees

	        Block types 96-101 contain absolute electric-field
	components resolved in spherical coordinates as follows:

	Block           Data            Units

	 96     E(R) magnitude          volts/meter
	 97     E(phi) magnitude        volts/meter
	 98     E(theta) magnitude      volts/meter
	 99     E(R) phase              degrees


	100     E(phi) phase            degrees
	101     E(theta) phase          degrees

	        Use block type 65 for peak E magnitude.


	Block Length, String Lengths, and Frequency

	        These fields are the same as for relative far-field
	blocks.


	Power

	        This field is antenna input power in watts.


	Coordinate System

	        This byte specifies the coordinate system used to locate
	data points (it does not specify the coordinate system used to
	resolve field components).  The byte is 0 for rectangular
	coordinates, 1 for spherical coordinates, and 2 for cylindrical
	coordinates.  Other values are reserved.  Coordinates are
	defined as follows:

	        Coordinate System       A       B       C

	        0     Rectangular       X       Y       Z
	        1     Spherical         R       phi     theta
	        2     Cylindrical       rho     phi     z


	Symmetry

	        The low-order bits of this byte have the following
	meaning when set:

	        Bit     Meaning

	         0      A-coordinate symmetry
	         1      B-coordinate symmetry
	         2      C-coordinate symmetry

	        Here, symmetry means that the data has the same value
	when the coordinate is negated (this definition is not the same
	as that for relative fields).  Any of the bits may be set
	simultaneously.  Bits 3-7 are reserved.


	Number of A, B, or C points

	        These fields specify the number of points for each
	coordinate.  0 is invalid.  The total number of data points is
	the product of A, B, and C.  For rectangular coordinates, the
	field is computed over a point, line, rectangular surface, or
	rectangular volume.  For spherical coordinates, the field is
	computed over a point, line, circle, disc, spherical surface,


	spheroid, or portion thereof.  For cylindrical coordinates, the
	field is computed over a point, line, circle, disc, cylindrical
	surface, cylindrical volume, or portion thereof.


	First A, B, and C

	        These fields specify the starting values of each
	coordinate.


	A, B, and C Increments

	        These fields define the sign and magnitude of the
	difference between successive coordinate values.


	Data Points

	        Points are ordered as follows:  A cycles from first to
	last, then B, and finally C.  The coordinate values of
	successive data samples differ by the A, B, or C increments.


	Title, Environment, and Notes Strings

	        These fields are the same as for relative far-field
	blocks.
